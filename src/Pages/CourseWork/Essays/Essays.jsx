            <Essay question="Q1: Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.">
                <p>
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all basic technology used to
                    build and design websites. Reviewing from last class, it
                    seems that each of them plays a unique role in the process
                    of web development. Hypertext Markup Language, abbreviated
                    to HTML, defines the structure of the content. Using a
                    series of tags to define each elements such as title,
                    headings, images, links, etcâ€¦, HTML is used to organize the
                    information rather than how it appears visually. Ultimately,
                    HTML is the backbone of the web page to organize and
                    structure the web page's contents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is used to visually style and
                    present web pages. Just like from the Sun And Moon lesson,
                    CSS allows the web page to style the image of the sun and
                    moon with a boarder, margin, padding, background color, and
                    so on. It also allows developers to visually design the web
                    page's layout, colors, fonts, and other visual features of
                    HTML elements. The separation of HTML and CSS, helps
                    distinguish between content and presentation, allowing
                    developers to make changes to the website's appearance
                    easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript allows developers add interactivity and behavior
                    to web pages. Interactive features such as dropdown menu,
                    forms, image sliders are all created using JavaScript. By
                    dynamically manipulating the content and styling of HTML and
                    CSS, JavaScript can create interactive elements for users to
                    engage in.

            <Essay question="Q2: What is the difference between Git and Github?">
                Git and GitHub serves different purposes. Git is a version
                control system that allows developers to change their code. Git
                is designed for developers to manage source code and any changes
                that are made to the files over time. Therefore, developers are
                allowed to make branches, merge code, and undo any changes,
                ultimately acting like a history log. GitHub is a web-based
                hosting service for git repositories where it provides a
                centralized platform where developers can store Git repositories
                on remote servers. Git Hub technically makes Git more
                user-friendly, providing a platform for developers to share code
                to other developers. Git is the most popular VCS that is used
                today. It is open-source, free, and designed to handle any size
                of project with speed and efficiency. Git also allows developers
                to work on various branches of code simultaneously and merge
                them when they are ready, also known as non-llinear development.
                GitHub on the other hand is a platform for a place for Git
                repositories, making it easy to share code, collaborate, and
                contribute to projects. GitHub is a Cloud-based, providing web
                interface to view file changes. It also hosts a large community
                of developers and various open-source projects, making it a
                great platform to collaborate. Git and GitHub are related and
                usually used together. Developers would use Git to manage their
                source code on their machines, and then push their cod to a
                repository hosted on GitHub, which allows easier collaboration
                and sharing of code. In summary, Git distributes version control
                system that operate locally. While, GitHub is a web host service
                built around Git that offers remote hosting, collaboration
                features, and the rest of the world to see it.
